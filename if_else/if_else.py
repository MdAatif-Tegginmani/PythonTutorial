#Q23. Write a Python program that takes an integer input and prints
# whether it's positive, negative. (Consider 0 as positive


# num = float(input("Enter the number:"))

# if num >= 0 :
#     print("The number is Poitive Integer")
# else :
#     print("The number is Negative Integer")



# Q24. Write a program that takes a character as input and prints whether
# it's a vowel or a consonant. (Multiple OR will be used)

# char = input("Enter the charecters:")

# if char == 'a' or char == 'e' or char == 'i' or char == 'o' or char == 'u' or \
#    char == 'A' or char == 'E' or char == 'I' or char == 'O' or char == 'U':
#         print(f" {char} is a vowel")
# else :
#         print(f"{char} entered is a consonant")

# Q25. Write a program that takes two numbers as input and checks if the
# first number is divisible by the second.

# num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))


# if num1 % num2 == 0 :
#     print(f" {num1} is divisible by {num2} ")
# else :
#     print(f" {num1} is not divisible by {num2} ")
    
# Q26. A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendance is
# less than 75%.
# Number of classes held
# Number of classes attended.
# 1. Print percentage of class attended
# 2. Print Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not.




# classes_held = int(input("The total number of classes held is:"))
# classes_attended = int(input("The number of classes student attended is:"))


# student_attendence = (classes_attended / classes_held ) * 100 

# print(f"The total attendence of the student is {student_attendence}% ")

# if student_attendence >= 75 :
#     print("He is allowed to sit in the exam")
# else :
#     print("He is not allowed sit in the exam")
